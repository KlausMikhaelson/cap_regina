# Model of re-entry trajectory of a spacecraft through the atmosphere.
## There are different factors that affect the model of re-entry trajectory of a spacecraft through the atmosphere like:
- drag coefficient
- initial velocity (have taken the angle in consideration)
- initial angle with which the space craft is entering
- duration
- planet's gravity
- safe g-load (normally astronauts are trained for 2-3g)
- atmospehere density
- area of the spacecraft (shape is kept in mind)
- mass of the spacecraft
- initial altitude when the space craft enters
## I have used streamlit to make it interactive for users to change the parameters and see the changes in the model in real time.
## How to run locally ?
- git clone `https://github.com/KlausMikhaelson/cap_regina.git`
- enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- enter `streamlit run main.py`
